Checks to be made on new dataset
- 'â€™' (Artist, Album, Track)
- ' / ' (Artist, Album, Track)
- ', ' (Artist, Album Artist)
- 'anniversary' (Track and Album)
- This should also look for when a track by an artist is on multiple albums
- And for common Greatest Hits names e.g. Singles, 

Planned analysis
- Album analysis
    - look at Tracks per album
    - Want to work out something akin to average plays per album formula based on the distribution to rank albums
    - Will require more info from Last FM for each arist
- Annual ranks for album/ artist/tracks. Top 50 tables for each year, including change from previous year
